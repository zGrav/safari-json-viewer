Parses and display JSON in a similar fashion as JSON Formatter for Chrome but in Safari

This was before I found out that I could convert the Chrome extension into Safari using xcrun and that worked, so all of this was... for nothing.

Thanks to [Berke Karag√∂z](https://github.com/BerkeKaragoz) for the icon!
